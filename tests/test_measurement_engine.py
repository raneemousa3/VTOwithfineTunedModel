# Explanation:
# This test file provides basic test stubs for the measurement engine:
# 1. Tests for initialization of both main classes
# 2. Tests for core functionality (pose detection, measurement extraction)
# 3. Tests for data processing (validation, smoothing)
#
# Next steps:
# 1. Add proper test data and assertions
# 2. Implement edge case testing
# 3. Add performance benchmarks
# 4. Add integration tests
